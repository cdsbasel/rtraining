Below are some of tips to get you through the learning process easier.\r\nUse the help function The help function in R can help you understand how the function works or what it is doing. You can go to the ‘help’ tab in the viewer pane and type the name of the function its search tab. Note: only functions in the currently loaded packages will show up, so make sure you have the package with the function of interest loaded with the command ‘library(packagename)’. You can also type ?functionname into the console (e.g. ?mean). Every function has documentation, and this command will bring it up. If you don’t know the exact function name, you can also type ??thingIamlooking (e.g. ??mean) to perform a search for related documentation. See this page for how to get help in R.\r\nSearch in forums There are many forums such as stackoverflow.com or stackexchange.com where many people ask questions on R. It is most likely that someone has already asked a question that you have on one of these forums and have provided detailed answers.\r\nDiscuss with other students There are many different ways of solving a problem in R. Chances are that a new, easier solution that you have not thought about emerges from discussing with others. Connect with your fellow students and don’t hesitate to work in groups as well as asking those in higher semesters for help!\r\nUseful Links and Resources\r\nThe internet is full of resources for learning R. Below are few of the most helpful links to support you with your learning.\r\nR for Data Science This online book has great explanations and codes to many of the topics that you will be going through in the R training. It offers in-depth explanations to R as well as to individual functions.\r\nYaRrr! The Pirate’s Guide to R This is another great online book to get you started in R. This book also contains great explanations to R as well as guides to conducting different hypothesis tests such as t-tests, ANOVA and regressions.\r\nIntroduction to Tidyverse Tidyverse is a set of R packages that share a common ‘style’. Tidyverse is a neat, clean and easy style of using R that will help you write even more beautiful code in R. This is also the coding style that we will be using again and again in this training program. Check out Brian Ward’s practical introduction to the most essential functions of Tidyverse.\r\nDatacamp Datacamp is an online learning platform for Data Science. They offer many hands-on lessons and tutorials in R. If you need a little refresher in R, we recommend that you go through the free course Introduction to R in Datacamp.\r\nRStudio Cheatsheets It would be impossible to learn all the different functions in R by heart, and nobody expects you to have these all in memory :) Cheatsheets are a great way to have an overview of the most basic functions and will make your life (with R) much easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However, if you are completely new to R or if you haven’t used R for a long time, we recommend that you watch these videos as a refresher.\r\nIntroduction to RStudio from MarinStats \r\nDownload and Install R & RStudio from MarinStats \r\nSimple Arithmetic in R from MarinStats \r\n1.2 Importing and Exporting Data\r\n\r\nOne of the most common, beginner problems that we run into is loading the data in R. Most of these problems arise because there are different functions we need to use for different file types.\r\nRead this chapter from the STHDA wiki page on Importing Data into R, which provides an excellent overview of the different functions to import data from txt, csv and Excel into R and also explanations on how to use them.\r\nTip 1: Focus on the chapters Fast Reading of Data From txt|csv Files into R: readr package and Reading data From Excel Files (xls|xlsx) into R, as these are the most common data files that you will be encountering throughout your R journey!\r\nTip 2: Use the Cheatsheets! They are a great way of quickly looking for a function you need. Click here to download the the cheatsheet for Data Import with readr.\r\nAssignment\r\nWe have uploaded a file on Github called Tourismus, which is a data set from Basel City on Tourism from foreign countries.\r\nCreate a new data set called tourismus by reading in the data on our Github page using this url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdsbasel/rtraining/main/data/Tourismus.csv\r\nInspect the dataset and answer the questions using functions. What does each column show? How many rows are there? Which country had the highest number of tourists? Note. If you get stuck or don’t know where to start, make sure to look at the Useful Links and Resources that we have compiled for you, which you can find on the homepage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This time, download the data on your computer and read it in R locally.\r\nCreate a plot using this data set. Make a plot with year and a variable of interest (e.g. Median Income), and show the different quarters. Include a title, subtitle, legend, and rename the axis labs.\r\nBelow is an example of a plot showing the median income of the quarters by year. Note. If you want to control the order of the discrete variables, you need to know some wrangling. Although you will learn about these functions in later sessions, you can already try to sort the variable “quarter” with arrange() and turn it into a factor with mutate().\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Tibbles, or tbl_df, are in fact data frames, but they keep what has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not.\r\nAccording to the tibble documentation, tibbles are “data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less (i.e. they don’t change variable names or types, and don’t do partial matching) and complain more (e.g. when a variable does not exist). This forces you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code. Tibbles also have an enhanced print() method which makes them easier to use with large datasets containing complex objects.”\r\nGo through the RStudio Primer 2.1 on Working with Tibbles, which will give you a sneak peak into the world of tibbles. If you want to learn more on tibbles and data frames, we highly recommend reading the tibbles chapter in R for Data Science.\r\n4.2 Isolating Data with dplyr\r\nWhen you have your dataset loaded and ready to go, you will first need to look at your data and make some changes before computing analyses or making visualizations. With the dplyr package, you can easily manipulate and transform your data so that you can work with it much better. In this and the following session, you will learn about a few of the most important and useful functions for data manipulation. These functions are essential for working with data in R, so take some time to understand them thoroughly and play around with them on your own data!\r\nGo through the RStudio Primer 2.2 on Isolating Data with dplyr, and complete the assignments below.\r\nTip 1: dplyr also has a cheatsheet for you - download it here.\r\nAssignment\r\nWe will be using the taxation data set from Session 2.\r\nSelect the columns year, quarter, income_mean and income_median using select(). Try to figure out more than one way to select the columns.\r\nSelect all columns with the name wealth. Note. Try using starts_with()or contains().\r\nFilter quarters that had a mean income of over 60000 in the year 2017. What are the quarters?\r\nRe-order by year and wealth_median.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In tidy data, each variable forms a column, and each observation forms a row. This is crucial for data manipulation, visualization and further analyses. If you keep all your data tidy, you will not have to spend hours transforming one format of data into another, in order to run analyses or to make graphics in R.\r\nIn the last 4 sessions, you will learn how to tidy your data with ease. For this session, you will familiarize yourself with the functions pivot_longer() and pivot_wider(), which are modern alternatives to gather() and spread(). With pivot_longer() and pivot_wider(), you can manipulate the layout of your data set.\r\nGo through the Tidy Data Topic in RStudio Primer 4.1 Reshape Data. Then, read the chapter Pivoting in R for Data Science and complete the exercises there.\r\nTip 1: The cheatsheet Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr has visual examples of what the tidying functions do to the data set, which will be of use in these last sessions.\r\nAssignment\r\nFor this assignment, you will use the billboard dataset that comes with the tidyr() package. This dataset shows the billboard rank of songs in the year 2000.\r\nLook the the billboard data set. You will need to load tidyr() and dplyr() individually, because the data set is embedded in the packages.\r\nUsing a pivot function, make a new dataset called billboard_longer, and store the weeks to a variable named week and the values to rank. Drop the missing values.\r\nCalculate the average rank of each song. Which three songs have the highest average rank? Did you know these songs already?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
