## 5.1 Derive Information with dplyr

In this session, you will continue learning data manipulation with `dplyr`.

**Go through the RStudio Primer 2.3 on [Derive Information with dplyr](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/2.3),** and **complete the assignments below.**

### Assignment
 
Using the **taxation** dataset, complete the following tasks:

  1. Create a new column called `income_labels`, where you have 4 new income categories **below 5000, 5000-7999, 8000-10999, and above 11000.** You can code the categories as numbers from 1 to 4. 
  2. How many observations are there for each of the four categories by year and by quarter? Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to answer.
