## What is a BSc thesis?

A bachelor thesis demonstrates your ability to advance scientific knowledge while obeying ethical principles of scientific conduct. Specific steps typically include

– developing a research question;

– conducting a systematic literature search; 

– summarising extant theories and/or empirical results;

– collecting and analysing data;

– reporting procedures and results appropriately (i.e., using APA guidelines).
