## 1.2 Importing and Exporting Data

One of the most common, beginner problems that we run into is *loading the data in R.* Most of these problems arise because there are different functions we need to use for different file types.  
 
**Read [this chapter](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/importing-data-into-r) from the STHDA wiki page on Importing Data into R**, which provides an excellent overview of the different functions to import data from txt, csv and Excel into R and also explanations on how to use them. 

**Tip 1:** Focus on the chapters *Fast Reading of Data From txt|csv Files into R: readr package* and *Reading data From Excel Files (xls|xlsx) into R*, as these are the most common data files that you will be encountering throughout your R journey!

**Tip 2:** Use the Cheatsheets! They are a great way of quickly looking for a function you need. Click [here](resources/session1/data-import.pdf) to download the the cheatsheet for *Data Import with readr*.
