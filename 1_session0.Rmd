## Introduction

For the first semester, there are 10 topics for four modules in this R training. For each topic, we have compiled different online materials for you to go through, as well as assignments for you to test your skills. This program is largely based on the great online tutorials from RStudio called [Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers). This training is a self-guided learning, which allows you to engage with the material at your own pace and at times that suit you the most. These topics will help you acquire basic skills in R, which will be most useful for your studies and in CDS Hackathons. 

Each session takes around 1-2 hours. Session 11 is meant for you and your tutors to review your progress.
